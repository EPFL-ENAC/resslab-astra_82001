I think I modified and saved it the proper way. Not all issues solved though. In particular for lines 29 to 33, these are incorrect as one shall use the definitions in french from ยง 5.3.3, pp. 47-48, of report 82001. I started modifying the english and french ones. Also, trans for me refers to transverse (or in the transverse direction), nothing to do with transmission. I modified but needs to be checked.\n\nSomehow, my edits were overwritten by this change. I will incorporate them again in a new branch starting from this latest version created by Alain.","files":null}]}
