But I still have questions regarding the width. Maybe we can schedule a meeting this week to resolve this? if it cannot be solved on comments here.\n\nExample:\nWe have a Box, with Bi2L width 14 and Span 60\nRegarding the current rules for box we should interpolate (   '12\u003cl\u003c 18': interpolate )\nBut we don't have a value for a width of 18 and a BI2L traffic, only for Bi4L\n\nSame for Slab.\n\nWhat should I do ?","files":null}]}
