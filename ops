For the 4 first, I wait a confirmation from Alain. Points 5 and 6  you could correct them directly.\n\n1. When R-BAU is activated, and pHi greater than 1.00, then the unique value 0.60 should be multiplied by pHi (it's a rare case, but it may happen for slabs mainly).\n2. When beta=4.70 and R-BAU activated, the alpha unique value should probably be adapted. I propose to fix it 0.65 instead of 0.60. \n3. We introduced a condition than when alpha\u003c0.3 then we fix it to 0.3 minimum. For slabs, when does this rule apply, before or after the adaptation for the dynamic amplification factor ? I recommend that the rule 0.30 applies after the increase of the dynamic amplification factor, because it my happen that a value of alpha (with good road quality) is 0.28 and if the road quality chosen changes, it may get higher than 0.30.  I think it is not the case, but please check.\n4. For the lanes, it is very good that we refer to article 5.3.4, still I think it could be useful to propose which trafic configuration one should choose in case of 3 lanes trafic so as to be coverd.\n5. I see no results for the transversal verification for the box girder, for 4  lanes. For 2 lanes, we see the same results for 9 m width and 18 width, @PaolaCostanzaMiglietta could you check if it the case ?  It could be after the intoduction of the minimum alpha 0.30\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be59d434-1f87-454d-9ce1-8fd542965e19)","files":null}]}
