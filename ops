I choose box girder and span varying from 9 to 12 m, it works fine for two lanes trafic. For more than 12 m width of course I get \"0\" (maybe it could be better the abbreviation not applicalble (N/A) or sth like that) and am obliged to change trafic configuration. I do so, I choose the **4 lanes** trafic, but unfortunately I get **no result**....\n2. **Twin girder** works fine for all conbinations. Thanks !\n3. For **multi-girders**, we can only choose 2 lanes trafic, and have the same results indpendenly from the width. I think it is right. @PaolaCostanzaMiglietta could you check. ?\n4. Still in multi-girders. Normally here span starts from 15 m and not 20.\n5. **Slabs.** It seems that there is **no difference** on the last alpha box (αq,Mx,Mid  and αq,Mx,Medge), when **changing the support**.  It changes when changing the span, or the point of control, 1,2,3 but not when changing the tyoe of support.\n6. I suppose the influence of the Dynamic amplification factor for not very good road quality is not incorporated yet because it does not change anything in slabs or in multi-girders under 20 m.\n7. @PaolaCostanzaMiglietta I see that we refer no to 3 Lanes trafic, I think that this is because the results for 2 lanes  trafic cover also the results for 3 lanes (of course no PUN activ). Since the width allows 3 lanes, should we give this information somewhere ? It could be helpful and avoid many questions.","files":null}]}
