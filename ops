I've some more final points. For the 4 first, I wait a confirmation from Alain. Points 5 and 6 you could correct them directly.\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. When R-BAU is activated, and pHi greater than 1.00, then the unique value 0.60 should be multiplied by pHi (it's a rare case, but it may happen for slabs mainly).\n\u003e 2. When beta=4.70 and R-BAU activated, the alpha unique value should probably be adapted. I propose to fix it 0.65 instead of 0.60.\n\u003e 3. We introduced a condition than when alpha\u003c0.3 then we fix it to 0.3 minimum. For slabs, when does this rule apply, before or after the adaptation for the dynamic amplification factor ? I recommend that the rule 0.30 applies after the increase of the dynamic amplification factor, because it my happen that a value of alpha (with good road quality) is 0.28 and if the road quality chosen changes, it may get higher than 0.30.  I think it is not the case, but please check.\n\u003e 4. For the lanes, it is very good that we refer to article 5.3.4, still I think it could be useful to propose which trafic configuration one should choose in case of 3 lanes trafic so as to be coverd.\n\u003e 5. I see no results for the transversal verification for the box girder, for 4  lanes. For 2 lanes, we see the same results for 9 m width and 18 width, [@PaolaCostanzaMiglietta](https://github.com/PaolaCostanzaMiglietta) could you check if it the case ?  It could be after the intoduction of the minimum alpha 0.30\n\u003e \n\u003e ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be59d434-1f87-454d-9ce1-8fd542965e19)\n\n- Regarding 1) Let's review this together, we missed something\n- Regarding 2) Okay\n- Regarding 3) it depends if it currently depends on if it's the beta or phi, the code looks like this:\n```js\n  const minAlphaQ = state.selectedClass === 'ClassOW' ? 0.3001 : 0.3001;\n\n  let alphaQ = currentAlphaQ ?? minAlphaQ;\n  if (state.dynamicFactorEnabled) {\n    alphaQ = getPhi(state) * alphaQ;\n  }\n\n  if (alphaQ \u003c minAlphaQ \u0026\u0026 state.finalEnabled) {\n    alphaQ = minAlphaQ;\n  }\n  // we apply the beta 4.7 factor after the minAlphaQ check\n  if (state.beta  === 4.7 \u0026\u0026 state.dynamicFactorEnabled) {\n    alphaQ = 1.07 * alphaQ; // 7% increase\n  }\n\n  return alphaQ;\n```\n- Regarding 5) Not sure I understand, we should probably review","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1738066182,"nonce":"/VTiEQVpiHDGAmLgu/mgJyRmUvM=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDONDZihM6cGB45","github-url":"https://github.com/EPFL-ENAC/resslab-astra_82001/issues/41#issuecomment-2618826297"},"message":"\u003e However, I realise, even though at a first look is not so obvious, that for the **transversal verification** the results are slightly bigger for the one way traffic. Furthermore, in reality, in a bridge with a large deck and large cantiliver, it could be almost impossible to restrain the use to only to one or only to two way traffic for the transversal direction. A big cantiliever would probably have only one way traffic and two way traffic in case of traffic restrains for working site. The slab between beams could have either one or the other, but we can not exclude a change depending on traffic needs. So, to conlcude, in case of 4 lanes trafic, and width more than 12m we present, for the transversal verification, the results from **2 lanes one way** traffic which are the most severe. In that way we avoid the new choice button. In the end, this is a general aspect. Even in the case of twin-girder and multi-girder, for the **transversal verification** we have to present only the values of 2 lanes one way, which are higher, independly of the fact of one or two way trafic. I would keep thought the possibility to choose also two way traffic for the longitudinal verification, because there it has an influence. But for the trasnsversal verification, appart from slabs, I propose to present the results for 2 lanes one way traffic **for all** box, twin or multi-girder.\n\u003e \n\u003e A final point: In the documentation we speak about multi-girders with longitudinal span between 15 to 35m. On the results, we consider for the multi-girders, longitudinal span between 20 to 30 m. We have to ask Alain about it, because if we're limited to 30 we are restricting the use in comparison to the current official swiss code which goes up to 35 m for multi-girders. Ideally we should ask values even approximately.\n\nI'm not sure I understand how it should translate in the web-tool interface. @PaolaCostanzaMiglietta @charlottegiseleweil  I think we should review this","files":null}]}
