DE: Für 3 Spuren in eine Fahrzeugrichtung gelten die Alpha-Werte für 2 Spuren in eine Fahrzeugrichtung. FR: Pour un trafic à 3 voies dans la même direction, utiliser les valeurs alpha obtenues pour un trafic à 2 voies dans la même direction. IT: Per il traffico a 3 corsie in una direzione utilizzare i valori alfa ottenuti per il traffico a 2 corsie in una direzione.\nThis is actually because for the simultations, we considered for two lanes traffic the heavy traffic mostrly in the first lane and far less in the second. In the case of 3 lanes, the repartition is more balanced (75%-25%-0%), with no heavy traffic at all in the third lane. This results in case of 2 lanes, to higher alpha values for the twin and multi-girder, and no differennce for the box girder. \n\nFor the point 5, I realised what you meant and agree. Apparently, it is a bit confusing as it works now for box girders.  We may consider that the choice of trafic is a general aspect, which concerns the pavement on its integrity. So in order to have results also for widths of more than 12 m in one page (otherwise we have to choose 4 lanes for instance for the longitudinal verification and then 2 lanes for the transversal) I propose to present results for the transversal verification also when 4 lanes are chosen. \nThe most accurate way to do it, as you mention correctly, it would be in case of 4 lanes box girder to add a button to choose if we have on the cantilever or in the transversal span between the beams one way or two way traffic.  \nSo, for the case 4 lanes generally and one way traffic transversaly, we would show **for the transversal verification** the results of 2 lanes traffic in one way.\nFor the case 4 lanes generally and two way traffic transversally, we would show for the **transversal verification** the results of 2 lanes with two way trafic. \nHowever, I realise, even though at a first look is not so obvious, that for the **transversal verification** the results are slightly bigger for the one way traffic. Furthermore, in reality, in a bridge with a large deck and large cantiliver, it could be almost impossible to restrain the use to only to one or only to two way traffic for the transversal direction. A big cantiliever would probably have only one way traffic and two way traffic in case of traffic restrains for working site. The slab between beams could have either one or the other, but we can not exclude a change depending on traffic needs. So, to conlcude, in case of 4 lanes trafic, and width more than 12m we present, for the transversal verification, the results from **2 lanes one way** traffic which are the most severe. In that way we avoid the new choice button. In the end, this is a general aspect.  Even in the case of twin-girder and multi-girder, for the **transversal verification** we have to present only the values of 2 lanes one way, which are higher, independly of the fact of one or two way trafic. I would keep thought the possibility to choose also two way traffic for the longitudinal verification, because there it has an influence. But for the trasnsversal verification, appart from slabs, I propose to present the results for 2 lanes one way traffic **for all** box, twin or multi-girder.\n\nA final point: In the documentation we speak about multi-girders with longitudinal span between 15 to 35m. On the results, we consider for the multi-girders, longitudinal span between 20 to 30 m. We have to ask Alain about it, because if we're limited to 30 we are restricting the use in comparison to the current official swiss code which goes up to 35 m for multi-girders.  Ideally we should ask values even approximately.","files":null},{"type":6,"timestamp":1737736170,"nonce":"Auarjp1OsNDjJ3ZthWtkDoFF0U8=","metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lALONDZihM6bve7Kzlq2zVE"},"target":"9357f18ef8a5dc7bec7322743ca7795a48d2a683f1cc56da1a20cf7030a8284a","message":"Dear all, I understand Alain's position.\n\n@PaolaCostanzaMiglietta I agree with you too. \nSo we may consider that points 1,2 as well the 3rd,  with your suggestion: if alpha*phi \u003c0.3 then == 0.3, can be easily handled as suggested.\n\nFor point 4, we may add a footnote EN: For 3 lanes trafic in one direction use the alpha values obtained for 2 lanes trafic in one direction.
