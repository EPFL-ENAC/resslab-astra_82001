However, since it is a mean value which means that we might have also sectors in stand 2, I propose to stay with your original text \"good quality\". In additiion, when I see the stand of the pavements in Europe generally, the \"good quality\" in Switzerland corresponds actually to \"very good\" for the pavements at least in the neighbouring countries.\n\nFor the p1, p2, and p3.  I think that with your  proposition \"positionnement de la ligne d'influence des efforts\" and in english \"positioning of internal forces influence line\" this point is also resolved. Thanks.","files":null}]}
