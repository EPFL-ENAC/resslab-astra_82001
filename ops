The support is always simple because it indicates the other direction, the one we are not looking at in this case of transversal analysis. Don't replace the cells of that column at all, just ignore it. It's a piece of information redundant for this (in fact you see it gives the same information as the \"Action effect\" column). It was kept there from the start to maintain the same format of output file with the same number of columns as the other cases.\n\nAlso, it seems like for _Dalle entre poutres_ in your example above you replaced all the cells in the \"Positioning of internal forces influence line\" column with PENC. Can you please make it like it was originally, as this is the column defining the transversal support type?","files":null}]}
