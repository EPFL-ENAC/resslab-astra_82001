There, for spans 15 to 20 m, the results are those for 20 m and it is also already implented. What is left is to do is to extend the possibility from 30 to 35m. For this variation, we may use the results for 30 m. \n\nFor the first point, I try to make it more clear if possible.\nChoosing the type of traffic, 2 lanes one direction or 2 lanes two directions, or 4 lanes two directions, we get the values of alpha for the longitudinal direction, that is to say the values of the two boxes, the upper right, and that of the center.\n\nThen, for the transversal direction, the independently of the traffic chosen, we may have, depending on the width, max 2 lanes on the cantilever part, and two or 3 lanes on the part between the spans. In that case, we should present for the third box of alpha values, those for the transversal direction in 2 lanes. More, we'll discuss from close.","files":null}]}
