We all wish him a speedy recovery. In the mean time he has delegated the decision making on this project to us. \n\nRe: @Dimitrios-astra most recent comments:\n\n1. I agree, it should be multiplied. It will be a rare case, but we want to have it covered.\n2. I just checked our analysis files. We don't have at the moment any R-BAU analysis with beta=4.7, unfortunately. I agree with Dimitrios therefore to assume a reasonable increase of the alpha value. Let's go with 0.65 for this case.\n3. I think the min 0.3 rule applies independently on the type of bridge. I am not sure at which stage it happens, if before or after the phi is calculated and multiplied. I agree with your analysis of your scenario: we don't want to artificially increase the value of alpha when and where it's not needed. @guilbep can you please verify when phi is introduced? Is it possible to modify the algorithm to be: \nif alpha*phi \u003c0.3 then == 0.3?\n4. I agree we should provide a suggestion. Spotchecking the data, I would tend to say that 4 lanes gives higher alpha values and should therefore be suggested to be conservative. However, I have not checked manually all the possible cases. Could we suggest the user to use whichever value is higher between the 2 and 4 lane options?\n5. For the transversal verification, the width and the type of bridge play no role (it is the data relative to the Dalle de roulement) . The only geometric parameter to be selected is the L that represents either the cantilever length, or the length of the slab between the supports in the corresponding sketches. Regarding traffic configuration, the only option considered is 2 lanes with either one way or two way traffic. I agree that it can be confusing as the longitudinal and transversal verifications can have different traffic conditions. I am not sure how to solve this. Perhaps having the transversal verification ignore completely what is selected in terms of traffic configuration, and add another dedicated button that makes the user select one or two way traffic? I hope this is clear, and I am looking forward to your comment on this.","files":null}]}
