I also agree that putting 0 is not a good idea. Can we put N/A instead?\n2.\tAwesome!\n3.\tCorrect. We only have results for 10.8m and we rely on the possibility of choosing which beam to consider to cover more cases\n4.\tIn our analysis, we only have results for 20 and 30 m spans. We can allow 15 m, if we want, but it would need to be the same resulting alphas as for 20 m.\n5.\tOn top of what @Dimitrios-astra already pointed out, I see that there are also other problems, like for example negative values and values less than the inferior limit (0.3) are appearing.  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e687e5d-a01a-4532-97ea-adb62fb58086)\n\n6.\tMaybe still being implemented?\n7.\tGood point. However, in the current version of the mockup we have added already an info button there referring to ASTRA 82001 ยง5.3.4 that describes the lane configuration cases we considered. Do you think this is sufficient or do we need more?","files":null}]}
