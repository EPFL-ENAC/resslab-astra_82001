Actually it looks like it is between 20 and 30. I am aware that for quite a lot of bridges with such a section (multi-griders) the spans is quite often close to 34 which was a very economic choise in the seventies and eighties. It would be a pity if we do not have values for spans up to 40. @PaolaCostanzaMiglietta  could you check with Alain if we may cover the span up to 40 m with the results of those of 30 m ? Thanks in advance.","files":null}]}
